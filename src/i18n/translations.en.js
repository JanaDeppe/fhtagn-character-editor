// Diplomat:
// As you sneak into the restricted area of the embassy during the welcoming reception, you discover that behind the faÃ§ade, there are far greater powers at play.

// Investigator:
// Spying on cheating spouses is not exactly the most exciting task, but you are dependent on those kinds of assignments. For the most part, you just sit in your car and wait, or maybe look for the best position to take photos. You have no idea that this time around you will observe something that will fundamentally change the way you view the world. Those eyes! Those teeth! You will never forget them!

// Driver:
// Almost done for the day! You just have to deliver one last package. Who orders something to an apartment building that has been empty for years? With this strangely heavy package under your arm - knees shaking - you set out to find the recipient. As you enter the building, you immediately notice that something isn't quite right here.

// Businessman:
// Something's wrong with the object you are dealing with. Inexplicable accidents, a high number of sick leaves and other strange occurrences. Wild rumors about a previous owner are spreading, and amid old files you find the leathery pages of an ancient manuscript. Well, you could leave it to someone else, but...there's just something about the story that captivates you.

// Law Enforcement Officer:
// In recent months, an alarming number of hikers have disappeared in your national park. That's why you set out to investigate the matter. Because in your park, no one just disappears!

// Faith Representative
// In the cemetery behind your church, graves have been repeatedly vandalized. You suspect a group of teenagers, but you've never been able to catch them. This morning things are even worse than usual. The gate to the crypt of the von Hohenfeldt family seems to have been pried open. As you approach, you see to your horror that it was opened from the inside.

// Journalist:
// You have received a blurry cell phone video showing an otherworldly library in which shadowy figures are talking to each other in low voices. So far, you haven't managed to find out where the footage was taken. Others think the video is a fake, but you're sure there's more to it.

// Lawyer:
// When you first visited your new client in his prison cell, he seemed friendly, intelligent and well-educated. Then he told you about the terrible events in the old country house, his look full of fear and madness. Something about horrible flying creatures attacking everyone? The whole story sounded completely absurd and unbelievable! So now you are on your way to said country house to find out what's really going on.

// Fighter:
// This so-called night ripper has terrorized the region long enough now. You are determined to put an end to this horror. What a perfect opportunity to show these braggarts that you are a real knight! Maybe they can take up embroidery or some other craft while you are out there, handling things.

// Criminal:
// It's simple. All you have to do is get the goods across the border unnoticed. Everything will be fine. The secret compartment in your suitcase should be nearly impossible to find. Also, you're much more concerned about that damn scratching noise you keep hearing. Wait, is it coming from your suitcase? That can't be.

// Cultural Scientist:
// The ancient cult, to which you have devoted a good chunk of your scientific career, appears in a wholly new light due to a chance archaeological find. The astronomical knowledge of this isolated religious community must have been far greater than previously assumed. But how can such a knowledge tradition have come from the middle of nowhere? When one of the central text fragments of your thesis suddenly shows similarities to research findings from the New Horizons mission to Pluto, your sanity begins to spiral.

// Artist:
// Your latest work will make you famous! All you have to do is finish it. Unfortunately, you've kind of been stuck for months. That's why you got yourself this neat little powder, which is supposed to boost your creativity. As you soon find out, it actually works. And those dreams! Those wonderful, adventurous and extremely stimulating dreams! How real they seem...

// Physician:
// You work in a small orphanage by the coast. A few years ago, a young, trembling boy was found at the foot of the cliffs. He's been living in the orphanage ever since. During the last checkup, you noticed subtle changes in his body that you find worrying.

// Idler:
// Until now, your life has pretty much consisted of the following: sports, entertainment, travel, shopping and parties. As the heiress to a massive corporate empire, you have little to worry about. This life could go on forever, if it wasn't for that old family secret. Something about an ancient mission to protect the world...

// Scientist:
// The signals emitted by the newly discovered celestial body indicate a pattern. You have converted the signal into an audio file. Surely you can decode the pattern if you just listen long enough. You're positive it will only take another week or two. You can do this. Until then, you'll probably manage without food and daylight.

// Homeless person:
// The stars will align soon, but no one is listening to you. You have to warn people! Somebody has to do something. Maybe it's time to take matters into your own hands.

// Educator:
// A disturbing number of people in your district have fallen under the spell of an obscure cult. You try to get to the bottom of it, but all your attempts are thwarted. After your colleague suffers an accident that simply cannot be explained by natural circumstances, you realize that you need to act.

// Psychologist:
// What your client tells you about this alleged attack by a maniac, which he claims to have barely escaped with his life, is absolutely ludicrous. The poor man is obviously displaying severe signs of self-harming behavior, because there is no evidence whatsoever to support his claims. He simply must have inflicted these wounds on himself. But then you read in the newspaper about a murder victim whose gruesome wounds show disturbing similarities to your client's injuries....

// Technician:
// You thought it was a good opportunity to help people, so you volunteered to build a well way out in the savannah. Now that you see the ancient chamber containing a broken circle of protection in front of you, you're no longer sure. Some things are better left buried.

// Survival expert:
// It's not your first expedition into the dark heart of Africa. This one, however, feels different. The closer you get to the ancient temple the scientists want to investigate, the stranger the coincidences that interfere with your progress. Perhaps you should have listened more carefully to the warnings whispered to you by one of the natives in the previous village...

// Watchman:
// What should have been a normal night shift at the tunnel construction site turned out to be a nightmare when one of your colleagues suddenly disappeared without a trace. She was found only a few hours later, dead and bloated, as if she had been lying in a dark pond for days. You're sure there's something wrong with the tunnel. Your next shift starts in a week. By then you should have probably figured out what's going on. Before whatever killed your colleague gets you, too.
